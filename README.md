# Machine-Learning-Projects-1-2

These are Coursera Projects for the first 2 parts from IBM Machine Learning Course series -

    Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning
    Supervised Machine Learning : Regression

House Price Prediction with Regression

This dataset was collected from Kaggle and is collection of 79 explanatory variables (features) describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. It has consists of 2919 records (rows) and 81 features(columns).

Data Wrangling and EDA (Hypothesis Test for Binning) - House-Prices-Prediction.ipynb file refers to the first part of the course and is a basic introduction showing step by step on how to perform Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA). Various techniques will be performed such as "Hypothesis Testing", "Binning","Multiple Imputation", "Log Transformation", "Plotting(Boxenplots, Histograms)", One-Hot Encdoing etc.

Linear Regression Project - Predicting House Price.ipynb file refers to the second part of the course and gives a brief introduction on building a Linear Regression model for prediction. We will be showing basic modelling techniques for Linear Regression including Regularization. We will also be talking a little about metrics used for our model for performance evaluation.

Note: - The linear regression project file is a continuation of the 1st part and wont show data cleaning/wrangling/EDA.
      - The dataset is already split into training and test set from before.
